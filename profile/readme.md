Visual Droids is a visual experimentation laboratory focused on assisting artists in bridging the gap between their art and technology.

We aim to help artists explore new ways to nurture their artistic creativity and enhance how they communicate with their tools.

We study and optimize their workflows through customized techniques and tools, so we can help them make the most of their skills and time.
